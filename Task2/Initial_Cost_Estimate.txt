Facts:
1. 50000 users/month

Note:
Given requirement is too abstract. Hence making following assumptions.
In addition, I do feel AWS Pricing Calculator


Assumptions:
1. Website requests are simple CURD operations
2. All requests are indexed, hence do not wait on DB.
3. 50k single region users, i.e. max active users can be 50k
4. But actual active users will be far less: Lets assume this number is 5k
5. User upload to website: 10MB per day/per user
6. User active session: 30 minutes per day/per user
7. User download: 100 MB per day/per user
8. 50 DNS queries per day/per user
9. Web EC2 processed bytes: 10 MB per day/per user
9. App EC2 processed bytes: 3 MB per day/per user
10. Number of EC2 requests: 60 per day/per user
11. DB size per user:
Fixed: 10Kb per user
Dynamic: 2kb per day/per user
